FEATURES:

- GPL (Part of the source code are dual licensed with LGPL and MS-PL)
- Need of the Microsoft Framework.NET 2.0 (if not already install) or Mono
- Display the elements, the groups and the attributes
- Show the text/HTML documentation of element and attribute when available
- Print the diagram
- Export the diagram to SVG, PNG, JPG and EMF (EMF only with Windows)
- Zoom the diagram with the mouse wheel while holding the control key
- Registration in the Windows Explorer contextual menu
- Drag'n drop a file from explorer
- Command line image generation


QUICK START:

- Open an xsd file.
- The xsd file and all its dependencies files are loaded in tab pages.
- Either:
	- Select a toplevel element in the toolbar (The first one is already selected).
	- Push the add button to put the element on the diagram
- Or double click in the right panel list.
- Then, on the diagram element, click on the + box.


COMMAND LINE USAGE: 

> XSDDiagram.exe [-o output.svg] [-so EXTENSION] [-r RootElement]* [-e N] [-z N] [file.xsd]

or on Windows use 'XSDDiagramConsole.exe' instead of 'XSDDiagram.exe' if you need the console:

> XSDDiagramConsole.exe [-o output.svg] [-so EXTENSION] [-r RootElement]* [-e N] [-z N] [file.xsd]

Options:

-o FILE
	specifies the output image. Only '.svg' or '.png' are allowed.
	If not present, the GUI is shown.
-so EXTENSION
	specifies the output image is streamed through the standard
	output. EXTENSION can be: png, jpg or svg.
	If not present, the GUI is shown.
-r ELEMENT
	specifies the root element of the tree.
	You can put several -r options = several root elements in the tree.
-e N
	specifies the expand level (from 0 to what you want).
	Be carefull, the result image can be huge.
-z N
	specifies the zoom percentage from 10% to 1000% (only for .png image).
	Work only with the '-o', '-os png' or '-os jpg' option.

Example 1:
> XSDDiagramConsole.exe -o file.png -r TotoRoot -e 3 -z 200 ./folder1/toto.xsd
	will generate a PNG image from a diagram with a root element
	'TotoRoot' and expanding the tree from the root until the 3rd level.

Example 2:
> XSDDiagram.exe ./folder1/toto.xsd
	will load the xsd file in the GUI window.

Example 3:
> XSDDiagram.exe -r TotoRoot -e 2 ./folder1/toto.xsd
	will load the xsd file in the GUI window with a root element
	'TotoRoot' and expanding the tree from the root until the 2nd level.

Example 4:
> XSDDiagramConsole.exe -os svg -r TotoRoot -e 3 ./folder1/toto.xsd
	will write a SVG image in the standard output from a diagram with a root element
	'TotoRoot' and expanding the tree from the root until the 3rd level.



TODO LIST:

- Tooltips above the diagram element with a summary (xpath/attributes/doc) (display 200ms after the mouse move -> avoid 100 %CPU)
	o The optional display of attributes inside the diagram
- Columns in the element/attributes tabs for restrictions (length/pattern/enumerations) 
- Element selection in the diagram + move from one element to another with the arrow key
- Multi-selection (i.e.: to remove several element at once)
- Save the current UI state (open file/diagram/zoom/...)
- Download xsd by specifying an Url instead of loading it from the file system
- XML sample (skeleton) generation (the ability to generate random test XML files complying with the open schema)
- Download .dtd dependency file
- On Linux, the horizontal and vertical scrollbars don't appear correctly.
