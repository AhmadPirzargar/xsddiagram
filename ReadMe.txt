QUICK START:

- The xsd file and all its dependencies files are loaded in tab pages.
- Either:
	- Select a toplevel element in the toolbar (The first one is already selected).
	- Push the add button to put the element on the diagram
- Or double click in the right panel list.
- Then, on the diagram element, click on the + box.


COMMAND LINE USAGE: 

> XSDDiagram.exe [xsd file]
 or drag'n drop a file on XSDDiagram.exe


TODO LIST:

- Tooltips above the diagram element with a summary (xpath/attributes/doc) (display 200ms after the mouse move -> avoid 100 %CPU)
- Element selection in the diagram + move from one element to another with the arrow key
- Multi-selection (i.e.: to remove several element at once)
- Save the current UI state (open file/diagram/zoom/...)
- Download xsd by specifying an Url instead of loading it from the file system
- XML sample (skeleton) generation
- Download .dtd dependency file
- On Linux, the horizontal and vertical scrollbars don't appear correctly.
